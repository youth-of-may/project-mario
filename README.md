# project-mario

Project Requirements:

* graphical user interface
* class inheritance (you must define a class or an abstract class that will be extended by at least two of the other classes that you also defined)
* inner classes
* animation using Threads or Timers 
* networking to send and receive game data 

Networking Requirements
The game must accommodate at least two (2) human players who will play against, or in cooperation
with, each other. The game must run on three (3) or more separate machines: one server, and n-1 client
players (where n is the number of machines).
You may add a chat system, but it will not be considered as a fulfillment of the networking
requirement. Examples of what are considered to fulfill the network requirement are: sending and
receiving player coordinates, generating enemies/obstacles via information sent by the server, etc.
You may receive a higher grade for more complex networking functionality. Generally, a game
where each player's movements are simultaneously mirrored on the other player's screen is more
complex to implement than a turn-based game.

Documentation
1. Create a game manual in the form of a PDF document named Manual-GameName.pdf. (replace
GameName with the name of your game). The manual should include:
a. the title of the game
b. the name(s) of the author(s)
c. a description of the game
d. an explanation of the mechanics of the game
e. detailed instructions on how to play the game
2. Each of your Java files should contain header information enclosed in javadoc-formatted
comments, containing a description of the class, your full name(s), your ID number(s), and the date
you created your program. This should be followed by a code block containing the appropriate
certification of authorship. Each class description must be written in your own words, with a
minimum of two sentences. Your inner classes must have class descriptions as well. Additionally,
your methods, including the constructors, must also have javadoc method comments.
